                    <p>TAG LINE: SMART CAFE THAT ACCEPTS SIGNALS AND ATTACK ZOMBIE & BURGLAR</p>

                     <h2 class="section-heading">Description</h2>

                    <p>This is our final project for HCDE 439, physical computing. It is a smart cafe. We build the doll house from scratch, and implemented Arduino piece then fit them together. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This smart cafe can receive signals from Gateways in Arduino, and make response to it. When it receive "Zombie Attack" signal, it will show the message on LCD screen, making buzzing alert, red LED alert and attack the zombie. The attacking system for zombie is turned on automatically after receiving signals. It is a spinning spoon that shoots out chocolate. There is also a button to turn off the alert after the attack is over. You can see that happening in video section.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The burglar attacking system is also turned on after receiving signal. There are two traps in the front and the back of the house. The front one is controlled by a pressure sensor, and the back one is controlled by a DC motor. </p>

                     <h2 class="section-heading">Purpose & Intended  Users</h2>

                    <p>The purpose of this project is to accepting signals form Gateways, triggering the server motors, sound & light sensors to attack the zombies and burglar. When the Arduino senses the signal of Zombie attack there will be a spinning spoon shooting out chocolate to attack the zombie, and when it senses burglar attack, burglar will be defeated by front door and back door trap. Intended users are people who are troubled by zombie and burglar attack, who needs smart pieces of the house to protect their business.
                    </p>
                    

                    


                     <h2 class="section-heading">Design & Functionality</h2>

                    <p>Design of this smart cafe can be divided into two parts. The first part if the doll house implementing. We purchased some wooden piece, decoration-used LEDs and wall papers, building the whole house from nothing. The other part is Arduino implementing. We designed it to be able to receive signals from Gateways and make response to it. It's functionality is to making buzzing noise (buzzer alert), red LED light alert and attack.</p>

                        Here is the system-diagram of Arduino.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Implementation</h2>

                    <p>We built a smart cafe house that responds to two signals: zombie attack and burglary attack. It contains three sensors: pressure sensor, pushing sensor (button), and potentiometer sensor. The actuators in the hub are three servo motors, one piezo buzzer, one LED light, and one LCD screen. </p>

                    <p>When nothing happened, the LCD screen will display: “Today is nice”; when receiving signals other than zombie and burglary attacks, the LCD screen will display that specific alert, but the hub will do nothing. </p>

                    <p>When zombies attack the house, the light will keep twinkling, the piezo buzzer will keep alerting, and the chocolate ball shooter (made by one servo motor) will keep throwing the chocolate balls to hit zombies until users press the button (pushing sensor), which indicates that the threat has been eliminated. After that, the LCD screen will display a message:”No threat”. </p>

                    <p>When burglary attacks the house, the signal will also activate the lights and piezo buzzer (but they will display a different alert and lighting pattern). Users can press the button again to stop the alert and lighting to indicate that they knows the burglary has come, and the LCD screen will display a message:”Detect threat”. Then, users can either press the pressure sensor to control the trap (made by one servo motor) on the front door to let burglary falls into the trap, or rotate the potentiometer sensor to control another trap (made by another servo motor) on the back door. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Design Process</h2>


                    <p>
                        In the beginning, we simply implemented one Xbee, LED light, and LCD screen to let the LCD twinkle when receiving a signal and print out the signal to the LCD screen. Then, we started building piezo buzzer into the hub and let it playing an alert when receiving a zombie alert signal by using an if loop. Then we built one servo motor into the hub so that it rotates when the piezo buzzer is making a sound. After that, we built one button to it so that every time users press the button the alert will stop. At this time, we have built in the initial hub with a basic chocolate ball shooter, alert, and lighting. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After that, we added one pressure sensor and one servo motor to the hub as our backdoor trap, and then added one potentiometer sensor and another servo meter as our front door trap. We also added one condition in the if/else loop to make the hub does something when receiving burglary alert. During this time, we changed the code of the alert so that it accepted an array of music notes as a parameter. This made the alert sound of the burglary alert different from the zombie alert.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Process</h2>

                    <p>
                        <strong>SUCCESS & DELIGHTS</strong>
                        <br>
                        One of the best part of this project for us is the process building the house. We enjoy the industrial designing and building process. We designed how the house is supposed to be, and started to searching for necessary pieces we need on Amazon. We bought some wall papers, doll house pieces and decoration LEDs, and we build the house. The process of building this house took about three weeks. It was really fun.
                    </p>

                    <p>The success part of this project is how we managed to blend our trap into the house. Since we build the house and Arduino pieces separately, we thought making the motor servers working on the roof of this house and under that yard would be hard. We managed to make it work after all. That's one of our best success.  

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>CHALLENGES &  DESPAIRS</strong>
                        <br>
                        Challenge is definitely the physical part. Hardware implementation turned out to be so much harder than we imagined. After test the Arduino and made sure that this could work, we started to build them together. However, fitting the three Arduino pieces together is so hard. It was also impossible to use the pressure sensors and such when we simply stuck everything in house. We ended up build a small door on the back of the house to fit everything in and control the traps. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despair stroke on us when we realize the spinning angel of motor server was really hard to control. We used three motor servers to control the spinning spoon and floor traps. We calculated carefully what direction and angel the motor server would go, and finally fixed it.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>REFLECTION AS A WHOLE</strong>
                        <br>
                        We totally enjoyed the whole process of making this project. We tried hard and went beyond of our initial requirement of ourselves and challenged ourselves. When we first designed this house, we were going to simply use a paper box and build a small room. However, we ended up building a prettier doll house. On the side of the Arduino, though we are not total expert of using Arduino, we still tried hard and got help from a lot of people. We added different features one by one, and at last pulled them off together. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One thing we learned from this four weeks of building process is: start early, because we iterate the design and implementation process. We built and took them apart and built again. This process made the final product much better. 

                    </p>
