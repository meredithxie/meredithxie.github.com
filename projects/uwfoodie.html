                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Problem</strong>: University of Washington Seattle Campus throw away tons of "leftovers" food. The dining places cook fresh food from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., and throw away all the food that wasn't sold around 3:00 p.m. everyday.</p>
                    <p><strong>Target Users</strong>: UW students who want to take leftover food for free.</p>

                    <p>In Autumn 2016, I teamed up with another three designers, trying to figure out a way to minimize food waste at UW dining places. We see UW Dining throwing away so much food everyday after business hour, food that are not given to homeless, UW students, nor even student workers. Here we have students living on tight budgets who needs the food, and we need to try our best to make our community sustainable. We can, and we should, help UW students to get free food and make the UW community greener.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Story Behind It</h2>
                    
                    <p>This story below is generated from my actual observation at <a href="https://www.hfs.washington.edu/HuskyDen/#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">the HUB</a>, a dining hall located at the center of UW Seattle campus. I have always heard that UW dining throw away so much food, but it did not hit me as much until I saw this.</p>
                    <a>
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/uw foodie/story.png" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>Seeing that student standing there, watching others throwing away perfect food that he wanted but couldn't have, broke my heart. I could only imagine how sad and disappointed he was. </p>

                    <p>There are people throwing away food, right next to the people who need food. I wondered, why do UW throw these food away? There are so many people in need, such as homeless. Why don't UW donate these food?</p>

                    <p>With all these questions in mind, I started go out talk to people, trying to get as much as information as I can. </p>





                    <h2 class="section-heading">User Research Process</h2>
                    <p>Before anything, I decided to talk to two groups of people involved: UW dining service employees (e.g., student workers, food truck coordinators, etc), and students who are UW dining customers and don’t work for UW dining service. I need to talk to dining service employees to figure out why they do not donate the food to homeless or give the food to students, involved policies and regulations. I need to talk to student customers to find out whether they are aware of the massive food waste situation, how they feel about UW throwing away the food, and whether they are willing to take those leftover food home free.
                    </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Motosurf food truck, operating on UW Campus center </span>

                    <p>Me and the other three designers started to reach out to UW dining service employees. Each one of us covered one dining spot on campus. I chose to conduct my user research at Motosurf, a really popular food truck located at the center of campus. I chose Motosurf, because I worked at this location as a cashier back in 2015, so I happened to know how this food truck operates. It gives me the knowledge of finding the right persons to talk to under different circumstances. Here is a diagram of different levels of employees at food trucks and their duties.</p>

                    <a>
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/uw foodie/15.png" alt="">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">How HFS Manager, food truck coordinators and student employees work together</span>
                    <p>I first talked to the food truck coordinator. Food truck coordinators deal with HFS managers and manage student employees, which makes them understand how everything works the most. The coordinator answered why they do not donate the food to homeless or give the food to students. It turns out that they are forbidden to do so by the HFS managers, and there is a law saying they should not give food to students for free either. Though the food truck coordinator hates to throw away so much food, eager to give those food to students workers who want them, the coordinator just couldn’t do so. I then met with HFS manager to deeply talk more about the laws and regulations. The law states that the money that bought the food was tax money, so it is not allowed to give food to students for free. Also, after regular business hour, UW cannot guarantee the quality of the food anymore, and UW doesn’t want to be responsible for anything caused by eating the leftover food. That said, food at 2:59 p.m., perfectly fine. Same food at 3:01 p.m., Ok, let’s toss them away cause they are bad (food truck close at 3 p.m.). I then met with several student employees, what’s interesting is that the coordinators sometimes secretly give them the food for free instead of throwing the food away when they are closing the truck, and the student employees are always so happy about it, because they really wanted the food.</p>
                    
                    <p>At this point, I started to realise that the information I am getting from interviews became highly repetitive, so I stopped interviewing HFS employees and started to gathering data from UW students who are only customers of UW dining (students who do not work for UW dining). I need to find out whether students are aware of the massive food waste situation, how they feel about UW throwing away the food, and whether they are willing to take those leftover food home free. I sent out survey to gather all these information. I made a survey on google form and sent out to UW communities on Facebook. Among the answers of 20 of my participants, 14 of them answered the question "Yes, I will take the leftover food for free". Common reasons are "It's free, I'm hungry, and if it's my choice whether or not to take it, it would be my responsibility if something happened because of the food.", "I'm sure it's still perfectly fine and I'll always take free food if it's unspoiled” and "It's free so I don't have to buy it / It's good and fresh still / I don't want it to be wasted!” The result concludes that there are more than half UW students really want to take the food home for free.<a href="assets/Assessment (1).csv" target="_blank">Here</a> is a Google Sheets of the results.</p>
                    <blockquote>"I am poor. I want to take the food, and I don't need UW to be responsible for it in anyway."</blockquote>

                    <p>So, after all these interviews, we realized that it is going to be really hard for us to make it work by handling food to students for free. However, me and my teammates still don’t want to see all those food go to waste. Throwing food away is definitely not good for economy or the environment, and the students need them. So I wrote a proposal about this issue, and my proposed solution to UW Sustainability office. I listed all the reasons and data I gathered, trying to convince them that this is an issue that worth solving and my solution could work. Now I am just waiting for them to respond to me, hoping for them approving my proposal.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">User Needs</h2>
                    <p>After user research, we have collected enough information that we need to start the design process. I carefully analyzed the data, and summarized four user needs:<br>The users(students) need to know:<br>1. where the food is<br>2. what food it is<br>3. when the food is available/until what time the food is available<br>4. how many servings of the food left<br>5.sign the agreement that UW dining is not responsible for anything caused by eating the free leftover food</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Design Solution and Key Path Defining</h2>

                    <p>Instead of using sticky notes like we always practiced during design studios, we want to simply makes everything as simple as it could be, for both UW dining employees and student customers. I understood that I need to solve the problem by passing the key information to students in the easiest way, so a mobile phone app is a great choice: smart phones are highly accessible for both students and UW dining employees.</p>

                    <a>
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/uw foodie/34.jpg" alt="">

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Me and my teammate trying to simplify the key path and refine the sitemap. </span>
                    <p><strong>Design Problem:</strong> How can students know where the food is, what food it is, when the food is available and how many servings of the food left? Now, all the information are with UW dining service employees, AKA mostly likely student employees.<br><strong>My solution</strong> is that student employees post all these information on the app, where student customers can view them. Student customers then come to the area to check out whatever the food they take on the app, and simply take the food. My job is to make this process easy-to-use, and of course, pretty. </p>

                    <p>Here is the final site map.</p>

                    <p>After finishing the key path, the next step is to transforming them into actual UI. I mainly focused on only showing key information that users need.</p>

                    <p>Here are the high fidelity user interface prototypes and the interaction workflow.</p>

                    <p>Mostly the flows are divided into two big branches: student customers and UW dining employees. UW dining employess input the information, where student customers view the information.</p>

                    <p>Right now, everything is still just simple proposed solution. Before UW Sustainability office approves our proposal, we cannot make this design actually into a real problem solver. We are now focusing on how to get approved and how to let the people in authority notice students' voice on this food waste issue.</p>
                    <p>I hope soon this design product will be turned into a real working app that helps students take the free food and saves the environment.</p>
