                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">How to compare yourself just to yourself</strong>
                  <br><br>
                  I am used to compare myself with others to make sure I am doing a good job. I compare myself to my classmates, or check out people's LinkedIn profiles to see where I am and how to improve. However, at the beginning of my internship, I really didn't know whether I am doing good or not. I simply didn't know what the expectation is. Also, I was the only UX Design intern at Irvine office, I simply don't have anyone to compare with.
                  <br><br>
                  Along the way of my internship, I gradually get used to stop comparing myself to others. On my weekly recap, I started shifting focus from "what I did that week" to "what I learned". I started tracking my progress as an intern who is learning and improving, instead of simply tracking my project. Now I look back, I can see the "current me" know more and learned a lot compared to the "last week me". I think this is a great habit that I will carry throughout my career.
                </p>

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">Every design problem has different approach. Take a big problem apart, and solve them piece by piece</strong>
                  <br><br>
                  What I learned at school, the approaches I took in class projects, definitely does not fit in the projects I did at Google. Designer are valued by problem solving skills, not flashing mockups. Being independent and being able to see a problem, figuring out what steps I need to take to achieve the goal takes time to learn and adapt. I am happy to say that during my internship at Google, I received great guidance and mentorship, not on solving design problems, but on how to solve them, how to break big problems into smaller pieces and solve them one by one.
                </p>

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">What to do with design feedback</strong>
                  <br><br>
                 Take notes and make sure I understand others' feedback, so I don't forget them. So the next time when presenting iterated designs, point that feedback out, and tell your teammates what I did based on their feedback. This way, I keep the design better, I make sure my teammates know that I take their feedback seriously and I made the work better, and keep the conversation and presentation engaging. I appreciate all the feedback, and people appreciate their words are listened and taken.
                </p>

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">Be patient. Don’t jump into high fidelity too early. You are not overdelivering, you are wasting time.</strong>
                  <br><br>
                 Make sure the team agree on the lo-fi before move on to high fidelity. Delivering hi-fi too early is not over achieving the goal. It's wasting time, while I should spend those time crafting the lo-fi.
                </p>

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">What is a good ask-for-feedback design package</strong>
                  <br><br>
                 Keep the placement text and image out. When in cases you need to have them, indicated them. Otherwise they are going to give feedback on them. Don’t waste people’s time! Also, have supporting comments on the mockups to avoid confusion.
                </p>

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">Don’t know much about the product? Go do research! Don’t know xxx skill? Learn!</strong>
                  <br><br>
                Keep learning and stay out of your comfort zone. When you are doing tasks that you have never done before and have no idea how to do it, it's a great time to learn. After completing the tasks, you have widen your skillset. 
                </p>

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">How to present design as a new member?</strong>
                  <br><br>
                As a new member and junior designer on team, it’s hard to present your designs with confidence while you know your team knows more about the product than you are. I struggled with this for a long time. I think the answer to that, is RESEARCH. Yes, your team are more senior than you, have more experience, know more about the product. HOWEVER, they don’t know about your own design as well as you are. It might take time, but research is the best way to back up your design decision -- and it's ok to make mistakes. Better do the research, and make the mistakes, and you learn from it, than too afraid to do nothing.

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">This is real life. It is not school anymore.</strong>
                  <br><br>
                Independent, learn, take initiative, figure out what to do yourself with limited guidance. I know, all students are used to having people telling you what to do. At school, I had my TAs and professors with syllabus telling me what to do, and they are always there to support me and answer my questions. 
                <br><br>
                However, a job isn't school. As a designer on a job, you need to be clear on what the detailed goals are, decide what to do, and just having your manager giving feedbacks on your own "to-do list" with deadlines that you come up with yourself. Don't let your manager tell you what to do.
                </p>

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">Before the meeting, you should have a lot of work to do.</strong>
                  <br><br>
               Treat every meeting very very seriously, especially as a junior designer. Be prepared! Do your research! Think about what other people might ask and always have answers ready! No matter it’s UX team sync, feedback providing meeting, or meet with PM and Eng. 
                </p>


                 <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">How to ask question</strong>
                  <br><br>
               I was always told that "when having questions, ask! Otherwise you are just going to stuck there and wasting your time." However, there is not only "ask question", there is also "how to ask questions". Good job for having questions, now go get answers! Do your research, know the context, and then bring both your questions and answers to your boss, to see whether you got it right. Don’t waste your boss’s time!

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">Make your work trackable and maintainable</strong>
                  <br><br>
              One great way to make impact on your team is to make your work maintainable and the progress trackable. In drive, have documentations of what the files are, what they are for, and make sure the categorization and naming is easy to understand.
                </p>

                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">Focus more on what you learned, not just on what you did</strong>
                  <br><br>
              Constantly making reflection on the work you did is a great habit, but what's more important is what you learned from it. Documenting what you learned on a weekly basis helps junior designers improve much faster than people who don't make such reflection.
                </p>


                <p><strong style = "font-size: 20px; color: #1b1b1b;">How to set an end goal</strong>
                  <br><br>
             Before joining Gamma for this internship, I had my end goal set to be "convert to a full time designer". However, that's a wrong direction of setting end goal. You do good on your job, you learn, and conversion is just an impact of those actions. Along the way of my internship, I gradually switched my end goal from "convert to a full time designer" to trying my best to take initiatives, producing better designs, tracking learning progress, and making impact on the work and teammates. I think my work got a lot better after I figured that out.
